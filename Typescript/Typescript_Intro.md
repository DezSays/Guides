## 1. Installation and Setup:

### Installing TypeScript:
To install TypeScript, you can use npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```
npm install -g typescript
```
This command installs TypeScript globally on your machine, allowing you to use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) anywhere.

### Setting up a TypeScript project:
To set up a TypeScript project, navigate to your project's directory in the terminal and run the following command:
```
tsc --init
```
This command generates a `tsconfig.json` file that contains TypeScript compiler options. You can customize these options based on your project's needs.

The `tsconfig.json` file allows you to configure various compiler options such as specifying the target JavaScript version, controlling module resolution, enabling strict type checking, generating source maps, and more. It serves as a configuration file for your TypeScript project.

## 2. Basic Types:
In TypeScript, you have several basic types that you can use to declare variables and function parameters. These types provide static type checking and enable you to catch errors during development.

### Boolean:
The `boolean` type represents a logical value that can be either `true` or `false`. It is useful for representing conditions or flags.
```typescript
let isCompleted: boolean = false;
```

### Number:
The `number` type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. You can use it to store numeric values.
```typescript
let count: number = 42;
let price: number = 9.99;
```

### String:
The `string` type represents textual data. You can use it to store strings of characters.
```typescript
let message: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';
```

### Array:
The `array` type represents a list of values of a specific type. You can define an array using the square brackets `[]` notation.
```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Tuple:
The `tuple` type represents an array with a fixed number of elements of different types. Each element in the tuple can have its own type.
```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ['John Doe', 25];
```

### Enum:
The `enum` type allows you to define a set of named constants. It assigns labels (numeric or string values) to a set of values, making them more readable and expressive.
```typescript
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

let favoriteColor: Color = Color.Blue;
```
In the above example, `Color.Red` is assigned the value `0`, `Color.Green` is assigned the value `1`, and `Color.Blue` is assigned the value `2`.

### Any:
The `any` type represents a value of any type. It allows you to bypass type checking and can be useful in situations where the type is not known in advance or when integrating with existing JavaScript code.
```typescript
let dynamicValue: any = 42;
dynamicValue = 'Hello';
```

### Void:
The `void` type represents the absence of a value. It is commonly used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.
```typescript
function logMessage(): void

 {
  console.log('This is a log message.');
}
```

## 3. Advanced Types:

### Union Types:
Union types allow you to specify that a variable can have multiple possible types. It is denoted using the `|` symbol.
```typescript
let username: string | null = 'John';
username = null;
```
In the example above, the `username` variable can hold a value of type `string` or `null`.

### Intersection Types:
Intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into a single type. It is denoted using the `&` symbol.
```typescript
type AdminUser = {
  name: string;
  role: string;
};

type Employee = {
  name: string;
  department: string;
};

type AdminEmployee = AdminUser & Employee;

let adminEmployee: AdminEmployee = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  role: 'Admin',
  department: 'IT',
};
```
In the example above, the `AdminEmployee` type is an intersection of the `AdminUser` and `Employee` types, combining their properties.

### Type Guards:
Type guards allow you to narrow down the type of a variable within a conditional block. They are used to perform runtime type checks and make the TypeScript compiler aware of the narrowed type.
```typescript
function logLength(value: string | number): void {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    console.log(`The length of the string is ${value.length}.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`The value is a number.`);
  }
}
```
In the example above, the `typeof` type guard is used to check if the `value` variable is of type `string`. If it is, the `length` property can be accessed safely.

### Type Assertions:
Type assertions allow you to explicitly specify the type of a value when you know more about its type than TypeScript does. It is denoted using the angle bracket syntax (`<type>`) or the `as` keyword.
```typescript
let message: any = 'Hello, TypeScript!';
let length: number = (message as string).length;
```
In the example above, the `(message as string)` type assertion is used to tell TypeScript that the `message` variable should be treated as a `string`, allowing access to the `length` property.

### Nullable Types:
Nullable types allow you to express the possibility of a variable being `null`. By default, variables in TypeScript are not nullable unless you explicitly enable the `--strictNullChecks` compiler option or use the `--strict` flag.
```typescript
let username: string | null = 'John';
username = null;
```
In the example above, the `username` variable is explicitly declared as `string | null`, indicating that it can hold a value of type `string` or `null`.

### Literal Types:
Literal types allow you to specify exact values that a variable can have. They are denoted by using a specific value as the type.
```typescript
let status: 'active' | 'inactive';
status = 'active';
```
In the example above, the `status` variable can only have the values `'active'` or `'inactive'`.

## 4. Functions:

### Function Declarations:
Function declarations allow you to define named functions that can be invoked later in the code.
```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

let result: number = add(5

, 2);
```

### Function Expressions:
Function expressions allow you to define functions as values assigned to variables. They can be anonymous or named.
```typescript
let subtract = function(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a - b;
};

let result: number = subtract(5, 2);
```

### Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for defining functions. They are anonymous and have a lexically bound `this` value.
```typescript
let multiply = (a: number, b: number): number => a * b;

let result: number = multiply(5, 2);
```

### Optional Parameters:
Function parameters can be made optional by appending a `?` to their names in the function declaration. Optional parameters allow you to call a function with fewer arguments.
```typescript
function greet(name: string, age?: number): void {
  if (age) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }
}

greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John!
greet('Jane', 25); // Output: Hello, Jane! You are 25 years old.
```

### Default Parameters:
Default parameters allow you to assign default values to function parameters. If an argument is not provided when calling the function, the default value will be used.
```typescript
function greet(name: string, greeting: string = 'Hello'): void {
  console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}!`);
}

greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John!
greet('Jane', 'Hi'); // Output: Hi, Jane!
```

### Rest Parameters:
Rest parameters allow you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. They are denoted by prefixing the parameter name with the `...` syntax.
```typescript
function sum(...numbers: number[]): number {
  let result: number = 0;
  for (let number of numbers) {
    result += number;
  }
  return result;
}

let total: number = sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```

## 5. Interfaces:

### Interface Declarations:
Interface declarations allow you to define reusable structures that describe the shape of an object. They can contain properties, methods, and function signatures.
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

let person: Person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
};
```

### Optional Properties:
Interface properties can be made optional by appending a `?` to their names in the interface declaration. Optional properties allow flexibility in object structure.
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

let person1: Person = {
  name: 'John',
};

let person2: Person = {
  name: 'Jane',
  age: 30,
};
```

### Readonly Properties:
Interface properties can be made readonly by using the `readonly` modifier. Readonly properties can only be assigned a value when the object is created and cannot be changed afterwards.
```typescript
interface Point {
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
}

let point: Point = { x: 5, y: 10 };
point.x = 7; // Error: Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a read-only property.
```

### Extending Interfaces:
Interfaces can extend other interfaces to inherit their members. This allows you to build on existing interfaces and create more specialized interfaces.
```typescript


interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  department: string;
}

let employee: Employee = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  department: 'IT',
};
```

### Implementing Interfaces:
Classes in TypeScript can implement interfaces, ensuring that they adhere to the structure defined by the interface.
```typescript
interface Printable {
  print(): void;
}

class Document implements Printable {
  print(): void {
    console.log('Printing document...');
  }
}
```

- [TypeScript - Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)


## 6. Classes:

### Class Declarations:
Class declarations allow you to define blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods) into a single unit.
```typescript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet(): void {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

let person: Person = new Person('John', 25);
person.greet();
```

### Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, and `protected`) control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

- `public` members are accessible from anywhere.
- `private` members are only accessible within the class that defines them.
- `protected` members are accessible within the class that defines them and any derived classes.

```typescript
class Person {
  private name: string;
  protected age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet(): void {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, department: string) {
    super(name, age);
    this.department = department;
  }

  displayInfo(): void {
    console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}, Department: ${this.department}`);
  }
}

let employee: Employee = new Employee('John', 25, 'IT');
employee.displayInfo(); // Output: Name: John, Age: 25, Department: IT
employee.greet(); // Error: Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
```

### Inheritance:
Classes in TypeScript support single inheritance. A derived class can inherit properties and methods from a base class using the `extends` keyword.
```typescript
class Animal {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log('Making sound...');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark(): void {
    console.log('Woof woof!');
  }
}

let dog: Dog = new Dog('Buddy');
dog.makeSound(); // Output: Making sound...
dog.bark(); // Output: Woof woof!
```

### Static Members:
Static members belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. They can be accessed directly on the class without creating an object.
```typescript
class MathUtils {
  static PI: number = 3.14159;

  static calculateArea(radius: number): number {
    return MathUtils.PI * radius * radius;
  }
}

let radius: number = 5;
let area: number = MathUtils.calculateArea(radius);
console.log(`The area of the circle is ${area}.`);
```

### Abstract Classes:


Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They serve as base classes for other classes and can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.
```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  abstract calculateArea(): number;
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;

  constructor(radius: number) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

let circle: Circle = new Circle(5);
let area: number = circle.calculateArea();
console.log(`The area of the circle is ${area}.`);
```

## 7. Modules:

### Importing and Exporting Modules:
Modules in TypeScript allow you to organize code into separate files and control the visibility of the code using `import` and `export` statements.

To export a value or a member from a module, use the `export` keyword:
```typescript
// utils.ts
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

To import a value or a member from a module, use the `import` keyword:
```typescript
// app.ts
import { add } from './utils';

let result: number = add(5, 2);
console.log(`The result is ${result}.`);
```

### Default Exports:
A module can have a default export, which is the fallback export for a module when importing without specifying a name.
```typescript
// utils.ts
export default function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

```typescript
// app.ts
import add from './utils';

let result: number = add(5, 2);
console.log(`The result is ${result}.`);
```

### Re-exports:
Modules can re-export values from other modules using the `export` statement. This allows you to create a higher-level module that provides a convenient way to import multiple values from different modules.
```typescript
// utils1.ts
export function multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b;
}
```

```typescript
// utils2.ts
export function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a / b;
}
```

```typescript
// utils.ts
export { multiply } from './utils1';
export { divide } from './utils2';
```

```typescript
// app.ts
import { multiply, divide } from './utils';

let product: number = multiply(5, 2);
let quotient: number = divide(10, 2);
console.log(`The product is ${product} and the quotient is ${quotient}.`);
```
