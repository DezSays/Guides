1. Download PostgreSQL: Go to the PostgreSQL download page (https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and select the version of PostgreSQL you want to download. Choose the appropriate version based on your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit) and click on the download link.

2. Install PostgreSQL: Once the download is complete, double-click on the downloaded file to start the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. During the installation process, you will be prompted to set a password for the PostgreSQL superuser (postgres).

3. Launch PostgreSQL: Once the installation is complete, launch the PostgreSQL server by going to the Start menu and searching for "pgAdmin". Click on the "pgAdmin" icon to launch the application.

4. Connect to PostgreSQL: In the pgAdmin application, click on the "Add New Server" button to create a new server connection. Enter a name for the server connection, then enter the following information:

- Host name/address: localhost
- Port: 5432
- Username: postgres
- Password: the password you set during the installation process

Click on the "Save" button to save the server connection.

5. Configure the path: Now that you have successfully installed PostgreSQL, we need to configure the path. This will allow you to use the command line in VS Code. First, you need to have the bin path of your install. To get that path, use these steps:
- Open a command prompt or terminal window.
- Type "pg_config --bindir" (without the quotes) and press Enter.
- The output will display the directory path for the PostgreSQL binaries. Copy this path.
In the windows search bar, type: Edit the system environment variables. Once you click on that, system properties should pop up. Navigate to the tab labeled Advanced, and in the bottom right corner click on Environment Variables. Another window called Environment Variables should pop up. Under 'User variables for -your username-', there should be an element called Path. Click on Path, and select the Edit button. Now you want to paste the path for the PostgreSQL bin.

There you have it! You have installed and configured PostgreSQL!
