Step 1: Create a new project folder - 
Create a new folder for your project. You can name it whatever you like. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

Step 2: Initialize a new npm project - 
In the terminal, run the following command to initialize a new npm project and follow the prompts:
```
npm init
```
This command will create a `package.json` file that will store the project's dependencies and configuration.

Step 3: Install Vite.js - 
To install Vite.js, run the following command in the terminal:
```
npm install vite --save-dev
```
This command will install Vite.js as a development dependency and save it to the `package.json` file.

Step 4: Create a new React project with Vite.js - 
Run the following command in the terminal to create a new React project using Vite.js:
```
npx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
This command will create a new folder called `my-react-app` with the basic structure of a React application using Vite.js.

Step 5: Navigate to the project folder - 
Navigate to the newly created project folder using the following command:
```
cd my-react-app
```
Step 6: Install Dependencies - 
cd into my-react-app and run the following command:
```
npm install
```

Step 7: Start the development server - 
To start the development server and see your React application in action, run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This command will compile and bundle your code and start a local development server. You should see a message indicating that the server is running and a URL (typically http://localhost:3000) where you can access your application.

That's it! You have successfully set up a simple React application using Vite.js and npm, choosing React and JavaScript as the template and language, respectively. Feel free to customize and expand upon this starting point to build more complex applications.
